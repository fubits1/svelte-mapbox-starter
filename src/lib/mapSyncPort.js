 * Sync movements of two maps.
 *
 * All interactions that result in movement end up firing
 * a "move" event. The trick here, though, is to
 * ensure that movements don't cycle from one map
 * to the other and back again, because such a cycle
 * - could cause an infinite loop
 * - prematurely halts prolonged movements like
 *   double-click zooming, box-zooming, and flying
